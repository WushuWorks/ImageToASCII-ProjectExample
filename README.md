# ImageToASKII-ProjectExample
> This project is mainly for example to show what a decent layout of a project could be.
## Short Description
---

## Project Status
---
WORK IN PROGRESS
## Deadline
---
 18-10-2024 (DD-MM-YYYY)
 On the above date we will reevaluate the deadline and determine if we will continue the project. // This is still ambiguous
> ### How will we determine if we will continue the project 
> - Is the project complete if so poject ends. // How do you know that this project is complete?
> - Is there other ways to acomplish the same task or goal that would spend less time?
> - Has the origenal purpose of the project changed.
> - Is our time better spent elsewhere.
## How will we determine when this project is complete.
---
- All test images are converted to ASKII into the terminal via standard out, in which must be visual simmaler to the origenal test image.
> We will mainly and subjectively verifly that the stnadard out is simmaler to the test image.
- The project is fully documented and checked for spelling errors.
- The test images will come from the the [Image Compression Benchmark By Rawzor](https://imagecompression.info/test_images/) from the RGB 8 bit set. The images are excluded from this project. This is to have a standard image set, incase otheres want to test the program.
- The test images will be converted using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to the most common formats (JPEG, PNG) for that is what we are concerned with.
