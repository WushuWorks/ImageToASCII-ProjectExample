# Techical doc
This document goes in depth into the technical aspects of 
## Deadline
**18-10-2024 (DD-MM-YYYY)**   
On the above date we will reevaluate the deadline and determine if we will continue the project.
### How will we determine if we will continue the project 
- Is the project complete if so project ends.
- Is there other ways to accomplish the same task or goal that would spend less time?
- Has the original purpose of the project changed.
- Is our time better spent elsewhere.
## Determining project completeness.
- All test images are converted to ASKII into the terminal via standard out, in which must be visual similar to the original test image.
> We will manually and subjectively verify that the standard out is similar to the test image.
- The project is fully documented and checked for spelling errors.
- The test images will come from the the [Image Compression Benchmark By Rawzor](https://imagecompression.info/test_images/) from the RGB 8 bit set. The images are excluded from this project. This is to have a standard image set, in case others want to test the program.
- The test images will be converted using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to the most common formats (JPEG, PNG) for that is what we are concerned with.
